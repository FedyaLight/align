Align synchronizes camera footage and separately recorded audio using waveform
matching, timecode, and recording metadata.

## What's new in @VERSION@

- **Application menu on Windows and Linux.** The Menu button is available in
  the top toolbar and on the empty start screen. It opens About, Check for
  Updates, Use with AI Agents, Path Fixer, analysis-cache settings, and theme
  selection using the same actions as the native macOS menu. macOS continues
  to use its native menu bar without an in-window Menu button.
- **Consistent menu contents.** The in-window menu follows the registered
  application menus, including the selected theme. macOS system items such as
  Services, Hide, and Window are omitted.
- **Escape to dismiss.** Escape closes the application menu, timeline context
  menu, and About panel. Clicking outside the application menu also closes it.

## Downloads

| Platform | Installer |
| :--- | :--- |
| macOS 15+ (Apple Silicon) | `Align-@VERSION@-macOS-arm64.dmg` |
| Windows 10/11 (x64) | `Align-@VERSION@-Windows-x64-Setup.exe` |
| Fedora (x86_64) | `Align-@VERSION@-Fedora-x86_64-Setup.run` or `Align-@VERSION@-Fedora-x86_64.rpm` |
| Omarchy / Arch Linux (x86_64) | `Align-@VERSION@-Omarchy-x86_64-Setup.run` or `align-@VERSION@-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` |

Every build includes the desktop app, the CLI, the MCP server, and the AAF
module. No separate Python installation is needed.

### macOS

Open the DMG and drag **Align** to **Applications**. The app is ad-hoc signed,
not Developer ID signed or notarized. If macOS says the app is damaged, move it
to `/Applications`, then for a copy downloaded from this release run:

```sh
sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Align.app"
open "/Applications/Align.app"
```

### Windows

Run `Align-@VERSION@-Windows-x64-Setup.exe`. It installs for the current user,
adds Align to the Start menu, and installs the Microsoft VC++ runtime if needed.
Running it over an earlier version upgrades that installation. The installer is
unsigned, so SmartScreen may ask for confirmation.

### Fedora and Omarchy / Arch

The `.run` installers open a graphical installer in Align's style and ask for
system authorization. Run them as your ordinary user:

```sh
chmod +x Align-@VERSION@-Fedora-x86_64-Setup.run
./Align-@VERSION@-Fedora-x86_64-Setup.run
```

Or install the native package directly with
`sudo dnf install ./Align-@VERSION@-Fedora-x86_64.rpm` or
`sudo pacman -U ./align-@VERSION@-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst`. Choose one method; each
`.run` contains the same package. Linux requires glibc 2.39+, a working Vulkan
driver, and GTK 4 with polkit for the graphical installer. Later versions install
from inside Align, behind the same system authorization prompt.

## Sources and verification

`align-source-<platform>.tar.gz` contains the corresponding Align source, locked
and vendored Rust dependencies, the FFmpeg source used on Linux and Windows, and
the AAF component sources. License notices are included in every installer.
Align is licensed under GPL-3.0-only.

Each download has a `.sha256` file. Verify from the download directory, for
example `shasum -a 256 -c Align-@VERSION@-macOS-arm64.dmg.sha256`.

Every installer in this release was built and checked by GitHub Actions: tests
and lint on all three platforms, end-to-end synchronization and export checks,
and a package installation test on Fedora and Arch Linux.
